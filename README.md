## 🛠️ What This Repo Is For — and What It Isn’t

| ✅ **This Repo Is**                                   | ❌ **This Repo Is Not**                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| A **static personal website/portfolio**              | A full dynamic web app / backend service      |
| A **public CV, research portfolio, project showcase**| A code-library or reusable package (unless specified in project terms) |
| A **single source of truth for website content**     | A mono-repo of unrelated projects             |

If you want to adapt this for your own use, ensure your repository is named `<your-username>.github.io` so GitHub Pages serves it as a personal site. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🔄 Recommended Maintenance Workflow

- Treat this repository as the canonical source of your website — all edits should go here.  
- If you regenerate files using Antigravity (or another static-site builder), commit **only** the generated output.  
- For version control transparency: before overwriting older builds, optionally tag releases (e.g. `v2025-12-06`) so you can revert to earlier versions if needed.  
- If you add reproducible code/data for research projects, consider adding subdirectories (e.g. `/projects/project-name`) with a `README.md` and license.
